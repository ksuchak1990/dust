# Particle Filter Project

This directory contains a summary blog post about the Kevin Minors' [LIDA](http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/)
data science internship project, Oct 2018 - Apr 2019.

The project involved experimenting with a Particle Filter to perform data estimation on a toy model
of a station ('StationSim'). The StationSim model is still under development, so for the most up to
date version have a look in the [parent directory](../) (later versions will also have better
documentation).

The files are:

  - Main file: [Full_Project_Blog_post.ipynb](./Full_Project_Blog_post.ipynb)

  - Underlying code: [StationSim.py](./StationSim.py)
