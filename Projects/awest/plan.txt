	1st Draft:   July
	Draft:       12th Aug
	Submission:  19th Aug
	Meeting:     26th Aug


Lit Review:
	Complexity Theory
	Machine Learning
	- Thesis
	- Why DA is different to ML
	Be clear about what isn't explored

Tech Report:
	ABM Evaluation
	Distros in detail
	Explore Model - Parametric Study for all params
	Redo Inflow/Outflow
	get_ani() -> FuncAnimation
	wiggles -> route deviations
	Analytic numbers are good, but explain why using those and the choose a final equation - r-sq is bad

Next Meeting:
	Aim
	- Reader knows nothing
	- Concise (lots of refs)
	- Read with notes
	- why / so what / what next

	Schedule
	- read*2, note, write, code

	Structure  (50 pages)
	- Lit Review  (Critical Evaluation)
	-- ABM
	--- Pick out things that will be relevant  (Scheduler)
	---
	--- Intro & Relevant Features
	--- Critical of ODD ?
	--- Calibration  (Simulated Annealing / Genetic Algorithms)  what they are, examples of what people have done
	--- Type of Models  (Markovian - WHIPP & Keiran's refs)
	--- Definitions  (Var, Param, State)
	-- DA
	--- Model, Data uncertainty and combining - data papers / books
	--- Methods (paragraph each), strengths and weaknesses (table)
	--- PF (lit review), what people have done, what is cutting edge.  Highlight gaps in this lit review
	--- Diff with ML
	-- DA+ABM
	--- who is doing this?  what are they doing?  well/badly?  where are the gaps?
	- Tech Report
	-- Model Eval
	-- PF Eval
	- Appendix
	-- Applications (as ideas for Case Study)
